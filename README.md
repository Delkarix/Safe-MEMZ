# Safe-MEMZ
A version of the infamous MEMZ virus, with the harmful features removed. This program was made from scratch (I did not take a single peek at the MEMZ source code).

Note: Since this project was made in C#, I could not add some of the non-harmful features like the mouse-jittering (C# does not support Cryto-randomization to my knowledge), message box spam (too annoying), random website spamming (too annoying and can be harmful depending on what website was opened), and earrape (C# does not support audio manipulation to my knowledge).

This program was also designed to be immediate rather than sequential, meaning that all of the payloads will run at once instead of being duration-based.

### NOTE
Unlike the original MEMZ, you can stop this virus by simply opening Task Manager (by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ESC). Future versions will give you the ability to close out of the program without opening Task Manager.
